## OVERVIEW
This application is the implementation of Apollo & GraphQL as a replacement for a REST API. Although very similar in many ways GQL allows us to send queries and respond with data in a simple request. Another major benefit of using GraphQL is the way it permits us to fluidly operate front end and backend logic. Apollo allows for our schemas to be exceptionally versatile.
